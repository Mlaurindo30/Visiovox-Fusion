# __init__.py for the visiovox package
# This file marks the 'visiovox' directory as the main application package.

# Optional: Define package-level attributes like version
# from visiovox.core.config_manager import ConfigManager # Example if version is in config
# try:
#     # A central place to get the version, perhaps from default_config.yaml
#     # This assumes ConfigManager can be instantiated without full app setup for this purpose,
#     # or version is stored in a simpler way, e.g., a version.py file.
#     # For now, we'll keep it simple.
#     pass
# except ImportError:
#     __version__ = "0.0.0" # Fallback version

# __version__ = "0.1.0-alpha" # Or directly define it

# For now, a simple comment suffices.
# We can later expose key classes or functions from submodules here if desired, e.g.:
# from .core.orchestrator import Orchestrator
